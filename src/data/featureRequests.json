    "title": "Add Dark Mode Support",
    "description": "Users often work late at night or in low-light environments, which can cause significant eye strain when using bright interfaces. Implementing a dark mode option would allow users to switch between light and dark themes, reducing glare and improving comfort.<br /><br />Ideally, users could toggle dark mode on or off manually. Additionally, the app should remember their preference and persist this setting across sessions for a seamless experience.<br /><br />Beyond eye strain, dark mode can also help conserve battery life on OLED screens, making it more energy-efficient. Providing this feature would demonstrate attentiveness to user comfort and modern UI trends.<br /><br />Moreover, accessibility improvements for users sensitive to bright lights can increase the app’s inclusiveness.<br /><br />Implementing smooth transitions between themes and ensuring all UI elements adapt properly will be crucial for a polished experience.<br /><br />Finally, documentation and support for this feature should be provided to guide users in enabling and customizing dark mode.",

    "title": "Two-Factor Authentication",
    "description": "Security is a top priority, especially for users handling sensitive data. Adding two-factor authentication (2FA) will enhance account protection by requiring a second verification step beyond just a password.<br /><br />This could be implemented via SMS codes, authenticator apps, or email confirmations, giving users multiple options.<br /><br />2FA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised.<br /><br />The implementation should be seamless, user-friendly, and provide clear instructions for setup and recovery options.<br /><br />Moreover, the feature should support future upgrades, such as biometric or hardware key authentication.<br /><br />Ensuring compatibility with existing authentication flows and minimizing friction during login are essential.<br /><br />Logging and alerting users about unusual login attempts can complement 2FA and boost trust.<br /><br />A well-implemented 2FA can increase user confidence and meet compliance requirements for data protection.",
